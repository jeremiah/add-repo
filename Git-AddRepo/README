ABOUT: This file is a README file for the "addrepo" tool. add-repo adds a new git repo to a local file system.
The purpose of this software is merely a little bit of glue that helps me manage git repos. It allows me to
push git repos to a new repo that is set up ready to serve via https.

This software is alpha quality - hic sunt dracones.
